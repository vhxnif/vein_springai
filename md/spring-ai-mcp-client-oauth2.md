Last month, we explored how to [secure Spring AI MCP Servers](https://spring.io/blog/2025/04/02/mcp-server-oauth2)\[1\] with the OAuth2 authorization framework. In the conclusion of that article, we mentioned we'd explore using standalone Authorization Servers for MCP Security and deviate from the then-current specification.

Since we published the article, the community has been very active in revising the original version of the specification. The [new draft](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization) is simpler, and the major change does match what we had imagined for security. MCP Servers are still OAuth2 Resource Servers, meaning they authorize incoming requests using access tokens passed in a header. However, they do not need to be Authorization Servers themselves: access tokens can now be issued by an external Authorization Server.

In this blog post, we'll describe how to implement the newest revision of the specification in MCP Servers, and how to secure your MCP clients.

Feel free to take a peek at the [previous blog post](https://spring.io/blog/2025/04/02/mcp-server-oauth2) for a refresher on OAuth2 and MCP.

## Securing the MCP Server

In this example, we will add OAuth 2 support to a sample MCP Server - the ["Weather" MCP tool](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-ai-examples/tree/main/model-context-protocol/weather/starter-webmvc-server) from our Spring AI examples repository.

First, we import the required Boot starter in `pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>

Then, we configure our MCP Server to be an OAuth2 Resource Server by updating `application.properties`:

    # Update the port so it does not clash with our Client application
    server.port=8090

    # Turn on OAuth2 Resource Server
    # This assumes we have an Authorization Server running at http://localhost:9000
    spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri=http://localhost:9000

Thanks to Spring Security and Spring Boot support, our MCP Server is now fully secured: every request requires a JWT token in the `Authorization` header.

## Building an OAuth2 Authorization Server

Our MCP Server now expects an Authorization Server to be running at `http://localhost:9000`. In an enterprise scenario, an authorization server is often already provided, either through cloud services or on-premise deployments of servers such as Keycloak. For this demo, you can use the Authorization Server [we provide with the demo](https://github.com/Kehrlann/spring-ai-mcp-authorization-demo/tree/main/authorization-server) and run it with `./mvnw spring-boot:run`.

Alternatively, you can build your own in just a few lines of configuration. First, we need the dependencies:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-authorization-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>

And then, some configuration that will be picked up by Spring Boot in `application.yml`:

    server:
      port: 9000

      # Cookies are per-domain, multiple apps running on localhost on different ports share cookies.
      # This can create conflicts. We ensure the session cookie is different from the cookie that
      # the client application uses.
      servlet:
        session:
          cookie:
            name: MCP_AUTHSERVER_SESSION

    spring:
      security:
        # Provide a default "user"
        user:
          name: user
          password: password

        # Configure the Authorization Server
        oauth2:
          authorizationserver:
            client:
              oidc-client:
                registration:
                  client-id: "mcp-client"
                  client-secret: "{noop}mcp-secret"
                  client-authentication-methods:
                    - "client_secret_basic"
                  authorization-grant-types:
                    - "authorization_code"
                    - "client_credentials"
                    - "refresh_token"
                  redirect-uris:
                    # The client application can technically run on any port
                    - "http://127.0.0.1:8080/authorize/oauth2/code/authserver"
                    - "http://localhost:8080/authorize/oauth2/code/authserver"

## Building an MCP client

The MCP Server and Authorization Server are straightforward to set up, with simple configuration. We need to put in a little more work to secure the MCP client. To get started building an MCP Client, regardless of authorization, please refer to [the reference documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/mcp/mcp-client-boot-starter-docs.html).

⚠️ Currently, Spring AI only supports adding security for the `SYNC` MCP clients, using a `WebClient`.

Ensure your application has the correct dependencies:

    <!-- Use Spring WebMVC -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Use WebClient-based MCP-client -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.ai</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-ai-starter-mcp-client-webflux</artifactId>
    </dependency>

    <!-- Bring in Spring Security -->
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client</artifactId>
    </dependency>

Then update your `application.properties`:

    # Configure MCP
    spring.ai.mcp.client.sse.connections.server1.url=http://localhost:8090
    spring.ai.mcp.client.type=SYNC

    # Authserver common config
    spring.security.oauth2.client.provider.authserver.issuer-uri=http://localhost:9000

    # Security: for getting tokens used when calling MCP tools
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver.client-id=mcp-client
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver.client-secret=mcp-secret
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver.authorization-grant-type=authorization_code
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver.provider=authserver

    # Security: for getting tokens used when listing tools, initializing, etc.
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver-client-credentials.client-id=mcp-client
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver-client-credentials.client-secret=mcp-secret
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver-client-credentials.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
    spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.authserver-client-credentials.provider=authserver

Notice here that we register two OAuth2 clients. The first, using the `client_credentials` grant, is used to initialize our client application. It allows setting up the session with the MCP client, as well as listing available tools, using machine-to-machine communication: no user is involved in that flow. The second uses the `authorization_code` grant, and allows our app to obtain tokens on behalf of end-users That client is used for calling the tools.

While it is not explained here, you will need to add the [LLM model](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/index.html) of your choice to your application to make it complete.

The next step is to configure MCP clients for Spring AI, by providing a `@Bean`:

    @Bean
    ChatClient chatClient(ChatClient.Builder chatClientBuilder, List<McpSyncClient> mcpClients) {
        return chatClientBuilder.defaultToolCallbacks(new SyncMcpToolCallbackProvider(mcpClients)).build();
    }

To add OAuth2 to our MCP Client, we configure a Spring Security `SecurityFilterChain` to turn on OAuth2, as well as a custom `WebClient.Builder` used by the MCP client:

    @Bean
    SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        return http.authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth.anyRequest().permitAll())
            .oauth2Client(Customizer.withDefaults())
            .csrf(CsrfConfigurer::disable)
            .build();
    }

    /**
     * Overload Boot's default {@link WebClient.Builder}, so that we can inject an
     * oauth2-enabled {@link ExchangeFilterFunction} that adds OAuth2 tokens to requests
     * sent to the MCP server.
     */
    @Bean
    WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder(McpSyncClientExchangeFilterFunction filterFunction) {
        return WebClient.builder().apply(filterFunction.configuration());
    }

To add tokens to MCP Client request, we need a custom `ExchangeFilterFunction` that decides which OAuth2 tokens it uses, depending on the context (user interaction or app initialization). It can look a bit confusing for Spring Security beginners, but feel free to use it as-is:

    /**
     * A wrapper around Spring Security's
     * {@link ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction}, which adds OAuth2
     * {@code access_token}s to requests sent to the MCP server.
     * <p>
     * The end goal is to use access_token that represent the end-user's permissions. Those
     * tokens are obtained using the {@code authorization_code} OAuth2 flow, but it requires a
     * user to be present and using their browser.
     * <p>
     * By default, the MCP tools are initialized on app startup, so some requests to the MCP
     * server happen, to establish the session (/sse), and to send the {@code initialize} and
     * e.g. {@code tools/list} requests. For this to work, we need an access_token, but we
     * cannot get one using the authorization_code flow (no user is present). Instead, we rely
     * on the OAuth2 {@code client_credentials} flow for machine-to-machine communication.
     */
    @Component
    public class McpSyncClientExchangeFilterFunction implements ExchangeFilterFunction {

      private final ClientCredentialsOAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider clientCredentialTokenProvider = new ClientCredentialsOAuth2AuthorizedClientProvider();

      private final ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction delegate;

      private final ClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository;

      // Must match registration id in property
      // spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.<REGISTRATION-ID>.authorization-grant-type=authorization_code
      private static final String AUTHORIZATION_CODE_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_ID = "authserver";

      // Must match registration id in property
      // spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.<REGISTRATION-ID>.authorization-grant-type=client_credentials
      private static final String CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_ID = "authserver-client-credentials";

      public McpSyncClientExchangeFilterFunction(OAuth2AuthorizedClientManager clientManager,
          ClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository) {
        this.delegate = new ServletOAuth2AuthorizedClientExchangeFilterFunction(clientManager);
        this.delegate.setDefaultClientRegistrationId(AUTHORIZATION_CODE_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_ID);
        this.clientRegistrationRepository = clientRegistrationRepository;
      }

      /**
       * Add an {@code access_token} to the request sent to the MCP server.
       * <p>
       * If we are in the context of a ServletRequest, this means a user is currently
       * involved, and we should add a token on behalf of the user, using the
       * {@code authorization_code} grant. This typically happens when doing an MCP
       * {@code tools/call}.
       * <p>
       * If we are NOT in the context of a ServletRequest, this means we are in the startup
       * phases of the application, where the MCP client is initialized. We use the
       * {@code client_credentials} grant in that case, and add a token on behalf of the
       * application itself.
       */
      @Override
      public Mono<ClientResponse> filter(ClientRequest request, ExchangeFunction next) {
        if (RequestContextHolder.getRequestAttributes() instanceof ServletRequestAttributes) {
          return this.delegate.filter(request, next);
        }
        else {
          var accessToken = getClientCredentialsAccessToken();
          var requestWithToken = ClientRequest.from(request)
            .headers(headers -> headers.setBearerAuth(accessToken))
            .build();
          return next.exchange(requestWithToken);
        }
      }

      private String getClientCredentialsAccessToken() {
        var clientRegistration = this.clientRegistrationRepository
          .findByRegistrationId(CLIENT_CREDENTIALS_CLIENT_REGISTRATION_ID);

        var authRequest = OAuth2AuthorizationContext.withClientRegistration(clientRegistration)
          .principal(new AnonymousAuthenticationToken("client-credentials-client", "client-credentials-client",
              AuthorityUtils.createAuthorityList("ROLE_ANONYMOUS")))
          .build();
        return this.clientCredentialTokenProvider.authorize(authRequest).getAccessToken().getTokenValue();
      }

      /**
       * Configure a {@link WebClient} to use this exchange filter function.
       */
      public Consumer<WebClient.Builder> configuration() {
        return builder -> builder.defaultRequest(this.delegate.defaultRequest()).filter(this);
      }

    }

And with that, we have everything we need! Asking our LLM weather-related questions will trigger a call our Weather MCP tool:

    var chatResponse = chatClient.prompt("What is the weather in %s right now?".formatted(query))
            .call()
            .content();

If you'd like to try it for yourself, we have [a fully packaged demo application](https://github.com/Kehrlann/spring-ai-mcp-authorization-demo/) available on GitHub.

## What's next?

This is a first step implementing full, end-to-end authorization. By using Spring's powerful extensibility, we can add OAuth2 to our MCP Clients and Servers, but it requires writing some code.

The Spring team is hard at work building a simpler integration, with the delightful configuration-driven Boot user experience.

We are also working on fine-grained permissions for MCP Servers. In more advanced use-cases, not all tools/resources/prompts in an MCP Server will require the same permissions: the "thing-reader" tool will be available to every user, but the "thing-writer" is only available to admins.
